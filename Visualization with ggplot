# Part 1 (Iris)  
## Background

The R data description follows:

This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

# Task

1) Using `ggplot`, as apposed to `Base R,` produce the same plot constructed by the following code. That is, plot **Petal Length** versus **Sepal Length** split by **Species**.  The colors of the points should be split according to **Species**.  Also overlay three regression lines on the plot, one for each **Species** level.  Make sure to include an appropriate legend and labels to the plot.   Note: The function **coef()** extracts the intercept and the slope of an estimated line.      

```{r}
# Base plot
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Petal.Length,col=iris$Species,xlab="Sepal",ylab="Petal",main="Gabriel's Plot")

# loop to construct each LOBF
for (i in 1:length(levels(iris$Species))) {
  extract <- iris$Species==levels(iris$Species)[i]
  abline(lm(iris$Petal.Length[extract]~iris$Sepal.Length[extract]),col=i)
  }

# Legend
legend("right",legend=levels(iris$Species),fill = 1:length(levels(iris$Species)), cex = .75)

# Add points and text
points(iris$Sepal.Length[15],iris$Petal.Length[15],  pch = "*", col = "black")
text(iris$Sepal.Length[15]+.4,iris$Petal.Length[15],"(5.8,1.2)",col="black")
points(iris$Sepal.Length[99],iris$Petal.Length[99],  pch = "*", col = "red")
text(iris$Sepal.Length[99]+.35,iris$Petal.Length[99],"(5.1,3)",col = "red")
points(iris$Sepal.Length[107],iris$Petal.Length[107],pch = "*", col = "green")
text(iris$Sepal.Length[107],iris$Petal.Length[107]+.35,"(4.9,4.5)",col = "green")
```

**Solution goes below:**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
iris<-iris
ggplot(data=iris)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length,color=factor(Species))) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Petal.Length, color =Species),method=lm,se=FALSE,fullrange=TRUE)+
  labs(title='Petal Length vs. Sepal Length', x= 'Sepal Length', y='Petal Length', color='Iris Species')+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=4.9, y=4.5), color = "blue")+
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x=4.9, y=4.8, label = "(4.9,4.5)"), size=4, color='blue')+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=5.1, y=3), color = "green")+
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x=5.1, y=2.7, label = "(5.1,3)"), size=4, color='green')+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=5.8, y=1.2), color = "red")+
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x=5.8, y=0.9, label = "(5.8,1.3)"), size=4, color='red')

```


# Part 2 (World's Richest)
# Background

We consider a data set containing information about the world's richest people. The data set us taken form the World Top Incomes Database (WTID) hosted by the Paris School of Economics [http://top-incomes.g-mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu]. This is derived from income tax reports, and compiles information about the very highest incomes in various countries over time, trying as hard as possible to produce numbers that are comparable across time and space.

# Tasks 

2) Open the file and make a new variable (dataframe) containing only the year, "P99", "P99.5" and "P99.9" variables; these are the income levels which put someone at the 99th, 99.5th, and 99.9th, percentile of income. What was P99 in 1993? P99.5 in 1942?
You must identify these using your code rather than looking up the values manually. The code for this part is given below. 

**Solution goes below:**
```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/Data")
wtid <- read.csv("wtid-report.csv", as.is = TRUE)
wtid <- wtid[, c("Year", "P99.income.threshold","P99.5.income.threshold", "P99.9.income.threshold")]
names(wtid) <- c("Year", "P99", "P99.5", "P99.9")
P99_1993<-wtid[wtid$Year==1993,2]
P99.5_1942<-wtid[wtid$Year==1942,3]
print(P99_1993)
print(P99.5_1942)
```

The 99th percentile for income in 1993 is 273,534.9 and the 99.5th percentile for income in 1942 is 189,140.6. 

3) Using `ggplot`, display three line plots on the same graph showing the income threshold amount against time for each group, P99, P99.5 and P99.9. Make sure the axes are labeled appropriately, and in particular that the horizontal axis is labeled with years between 1913 and 2012, not just numbers from 1 to 100. Also make sure a legend is displayed that describes the multiple time series plot.  Write one or two sentences describing how income inequality has changed throughout time.  

**Solution goes below:**
```{r}
library('ggplot2')
n <- length(wtid$Year)
Year=rep(wtid$Year,3)
Income=c(wtid$P99,wtid$P99.5,wtid$P99.9)
Percentile=c(rep('P99',n),rep('P99.5',n),rep('P99.9',n))
wtid.plot <- data.frame(Year,Income,Percentile)
ggplot(data = wtid.plot) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Income, color=Percentile))+
  labs(title = "Income Levels of Top Income Percentiles", x = "Year", y = "Income", color="Percentile")
```

While the graph shows that all income percentiles have generally had an upward trend (as is expected because of inflation), what hints at inequality is the gap between the three percentiles. The distance (i.e. amount) between the 99th and 99.5th percentile lines increases only slightly over time. However, the income of the 99.9th percentile has risen at a much faster rate than the other two groups, suggesting increasing inequality over time. 

# Part 3 (Titanic)

# Background

In this part we'll be studying a data set which provides information on the survival rates of passengers on the fatal voyage of the ocean liner \emph{Titanic}.  The dataset provides information on each passenger including, for example, economic status, sex, age, cabin, name, and survival status.  This is a training dataset taken from the Kaggle competition website; for more information on Kaggle competitions, please refer to \url{https://www.kaggle.com}.  Students should download the data set on Canvas.   


# Tasks 

4) Run the following code and describe what the two plots are producing

```{r}
# Read in data
setwd("~/Desktop/Data")
titanic <- read.table("Titanic.txt", header = TRUE, as.is = TRUE)
head(titanic)
library(ggplot2)
# Plot 1
ggplot(data=titanic) +
   geom_bar(aes(x=Sex,fill=factor(Survived)))+
   labs(title = "Title",fill="Survived")
```

This bargraph shows the breakdown of passengers by sex (there appear to be about twice as many men) divided by whether they survived (1) or died (0). We can see that women had a much higher survival probability than men. 


```{r}
# plot 2
 ggplot(data=titanic) +
   geom_bar(aes(x=factor(Survived),fill=factor(Survived)))+
   facet_grid(~Sex)+
   labs(title = "Title",fill="Survived",x="")
```

This set of bargraphs shows two plots, one for men and one for women, with two separate bars on each for the counts of those who survived (1) or died (0). We can see that women had a much higher survival probability than men. 

5) Create a similar plot with the variable **Pclass**.  The easiest way to produce this plot is to **facet** by **Pclass**.  Make sure to include appropriate labels and titles.  Describe your  

**Solution goes below:**
```{r}
ggplot(data=titanic) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=factor(Survived),fill=factor(Survived)))+
  facet_grid(~Pclass)+
  labs(title = "Survived/Died by Class",fill="Survived",x="Survived(1), Died(0)", y='Passenger Count')
```

Now, we have three barcharts, separated by the three passenger classes, with two bars on each for the count of passengers that survived (1) or died (0). Now we can see that the proportion of deaths tended to increase from first class to third class. In fact, first class was the only class with more survivals than death, second class has a roughly equal number, and third class has far more deaths than survivals. 

6)  Create one more plot of your choice related to the **titanic** data set.  Describe what information your plot is conveying.      

**Solution goes below:**
```{r}
titanic$ageclass<-NULL
titanic$ageclass[titanic$Age<18]<-'Under 18'
titanic$ageclass[titanic$Age>=18&titanic$Age<=65]<-'Middle Aged'
titanic$ageclass[titanic$Age>65]<-'Over 65'
ggplot(data=titanic) + geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=Sex, fill=factor(Survived)))+facet_grid(~ageclass)+
  labs(title = "Survival by Age Group and Gender",fill="Survived",x="Sex", y='Passenger Count')
```

This plot takes into account both sex and age in survival. I created a new variable separating the data into four age groups, Middle Aged (between 18 and 65, inclusive), Over 65, Under 18, and NA for passengers whose ages we do not know. Interestingly, there are no women over 65 in this dataset. The plot does demonstrate that women had a better survival probability than men in each group. It is, however, difficult to tell which combination of age group/sex has the highest survival probability. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = titanic) + geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=factor(Pclass), y=Fare,fill=factor(Pclass))) +
  labs(title='Distribution of Fares by Class',x='Class', y='Fare', fill='Class')
```

This chart shows three boxplots for the distribution of fares in each class. First class certainly has the largest range and highest median of the three groups, which makes sense. However, there are some strange points, e.g. second and third class fares that are higher than some first class fares. Possibly, these fares are paid for a cabin that could fit multiple people which is why they are as expensive as first class fares.
