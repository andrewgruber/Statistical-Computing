```

Section I

Part I 
```{r}
housing<-read.csv("NYChousing.csv",as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)
```

Part II 
```{r}
#Number of Columns 
length(housing)
#Number of Rows 
length(housing[,1])
```

Part III 
```{r}
colnames(housing)
```

Part IV 
```{r}
apply(is.na(housing), 2, sum)
```
This command tells you the total number of 'NA' values in each column. For example, there are 15 missing entries for the latitudes of properties. 

Part V 
```{r}
housing<-housing[!is.na(housing$Value),]
```

Part VI 
```{r}
length(housing[,1])
```
52 Rows were removed. This result does agree with Part IV since it counted 52 entries for which the value was NA. 

Part VII 
```{r}
quantile(housing$Value,0.75)
```

Part VIII
```{r}
housing$highValue<-ifelse(housing$Value>quantile(housing$Value,0.75),"High","NotHigh")
```

Part IX
```{r}
contingency_table<-prop.table(table(housing$Borough,housing$highValue))
print(contingency_table)
```

Part X 
```{r}
contingency_table[1,1]
```
5.58% of properties are in the upper quartile and in the Bronx 

Part XI 
```{r}
contingency_table[1,1]/(contingency_table[1,1]+contingency_table[1,2])
```
Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability of a property being in the upper quartile given that it is in the Bronx is 0.206

Part XII 
```{r}
housing$logValue<-log(housing$Value)
summary(housing$logValue)
```

Part XIII
```{r}
housing$logUnits<-log(housing$UnitCount)
summary(housing$logUnits)
```

Part XIV
```{r}
housing$after1950<-ifelse(housing$YearBuilt>=1950,TRUE,FALSE)
```

Section II 
Part I 
```{r}
boxplot(housing$logValue~housing$Borough, xlab='Borough', ylab='Log of Property Value', main='Log of Property Value by Borough')
```

Part II 
```{r}
plot(housing$logValue,housing$logUnits, xlab='Log of Property Units', ylab='Log of Property Value', main='Property Value and Property Units')
```

Part III 
```{r}
plot(housing$logValue,housing$logUnits, xlab='Log of Property Units', ylab='Log of Property Value', main='Property Value and Property Units', col = factor(housing$after1950))

legend("bottomright", legend = levels(factor(housing$after1950)), fill
= unique(factor(housing$after1950)))
```
This plot tells us a few things. First, property value and number of units in that property generally have a positive, direct relationship- i.e. properties that have more units also tend to be more valuable. We can also see somewhat of a split between properties built before and after 1950. The red dots (post-1950) tend to both have more units and be more valuable. The black dots (pre-1950) tend to have fewer units and a correspondingly lower property value. 

Part IV 
```{r}
#Correlation between logValue and logUnits for properties: 
#In the Whole Data Set:
cor(housing$logValue,housing$logUnits)
#In Manhattan:
manhattan<-housing[housing$Borough=='Manhattan',]
cor(manhattan$logValue,manhattan$logUnits)
#In Brooklyn:
brooklyn<-housing[housing$Borough=='Brooklyn',]
cor(brooklyn$logValue,brooklyn$logUnits)
#Built Before 1950:
pre_1950<-housing[housing$after1950==FALSE,]
cor(pre_1950$logValue,pre_1950$logUnits)
#Built After 1950: 
post_1950<-housing[housing$after1950==TRUE,]
cor(post_1950$logValue,post_1950$logUnits)
```

Part V 
```{r}
mb<-housing[housing$Borough=='Manhattan' | housing$Borough=='Brooklyn',]
plot(mb$logValue,mb$logUnits, xlab='Log of Property Units', ylab='Log of Property Value', main='Property Value and Property Units in Manhattan and Brooklyn', col = factor(mb$Borough))

legend("bottomright", legend = levels(factor(mb$Borough)), fill
= unique(factor(mb$Borough)))

```

Part VI
```{r}
median(housing[housing$Borough=='Manhattan',]$Value)
```
This accomplishes the same task of getting the median property value for units in Manhattan- $1,172,362

Part VII
```{r}
#Median of the Whole Data Set
median(housing$Value)
#Median for Properties in the Bronx
median(housing[housing$Borough=='Bronx',]$Value)
#Median for Properties in Brooklyn
median(housing[housing$Borough=='Brooklyn',]$Value)
#Median for Properties in Manhattan
median(housing[housing$Borough=='Manhattan',]$Value)
#Median for Properties in Queens
median(housing[housing$Borough=='Queens',]$Value)
#Median for Properties on Staten Island
median(housing[housing$Borough=='Staten Island',]$Value)
```
